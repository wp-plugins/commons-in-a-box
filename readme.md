# Commons in a Box

Commons in a Box is a suite of WordPress and BuddyPress plugins and themes for community communication and collaboration, put into a single package that is easy to install, customize, and maintain.

This software is a project by the [CUNY Academic Commons](http://commons.gc.cuny.edu) of the [City University of New York](http://cuny.edu) and sponsored by a grant from the [Alfred P. Sloan Foundation](http://sloan.org/). For more information on the project's origins and goals, read [the announcement post](http://news.commons.gc.cuny.edu/2011/11/22/the-cuny-academic-commons-announces-the-commons-in-a-box-project/).

# Important!

This project is currently very, very pre-alpha.

If you use it on a live site, it will crash your servers!

If you look directly at the code, it will fry your brains!

Come back soon for something more polished.
